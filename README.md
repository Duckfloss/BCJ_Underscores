BCJ_Underscores===This is a Wordpress theme I built for my own website: BenCJones.com. It is based on the fantastic Underscores base theme ([Underscores.me](http://underscores.me/)), with a bit of tweaking on my part. The theme itself is built from scratch, but I also included some code tweaks to strip out WP's default classes and IDs, for example.The CSS is done in SASS, and I used the [WP-SCSS](https://github.com/ConnectThink/WP-SCSS) plugin for compiling SCSS files to the regular, plain old style.css.
